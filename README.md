# Election Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
6. The voter turnout for each county.
7. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count.
8. The county with the highest turnout.

## Summary
After creating a python script to tabulate the winner of the election, the breakdown of votes and turnouts in the counties, I believe this script could be modified in the following ways to be used for any election.
- Allow the script to be able to read other fields such as State/Province and political party such as Republicans/Democrats/Liberals/Conservatives.
- Create a User Input so that certain fields can be specified for analysis and outputs such as certain States or political parties.
- Create code to be able to read and write other data formats.
