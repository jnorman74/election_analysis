6. The voter turnout for each county.
7. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count.
8. The county with the highest turnout.

## Summary
After creating a python script to tabulate the winner of the election, the breakdown of votes
and turnouts in the counties, I believe this script could be modified in the following ways to
be used for any election.
- Allow the script to be able to read other fields such as State/Province and political party 
  such as Republicans/Democrats/Liberals/Conservatives.
